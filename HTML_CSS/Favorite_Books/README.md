Favorite Books Page
Objective
The goal is to create an HTML page, favorite-books.html, showcasing a list of my favorite books. Each entry in the list will include the book's title, author, and a brief summary or personal anecdote explaining why the book is among my favorites. This project is an exercise in structuring content with HTML and provides an opportunity to practice styling with CSS.

Skills Practiced
HTML Structure: Utilizing basic HTML tags to structure text content effectively.
Lists: Creating ordered  or unordered lists to organize the book entries.
List Items: Using  tags for detailing each book, including its title, author, and summary.
Challenge Yourself
Images: Incorporate a thumbnail image of each book's cover next to its description. This adds a visual element to the content, making the page more engaging.
CSS Styling: Apply CSS to enhance the visual presentation of the list. Consider experimenting with:
Grid layout: Display the books in a grid for a clean, organized look.
Hover effects: Add CSS hover effects to each list item or image for interactive feedback.
By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to combine HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and structured web page. This page is not just a practice exercise but also a personal reflection of the books that have influenced me.

When you add this to your README.md, it will provide visitors with a clear overview of what the project is about, the skills you're focusing on, and the extra challenges you've set for yourself. It's a great way to document your projects for both your future reference and for others who might view your repository.
